# ProjectTimers
VisualBasic6 project (old)
This is a utility that helps keep track of time spent on documents for various tasks/projects while working on the computer. It works on a very simple principle: You create a timer and provide it with a keyword to sniff/detect. As such, each time you work on a document whose titlebar contains that keyword the corresponding timer will start counting. For example you can create a timer and have it sniff the keyword "Firefox" and this will keep track of  time you spend using Mozilla Firefox. If your work is organized so that each project you work on has a docket number  (or a database serial) appearing in the filename of each related document, then if you create a timer to sniff that serial you essentially keep track of time spent on that project.

    Right-click on the list to reveal a context menu
    In the edit window you can add a list of keywords to sniff.
    In the edit window you can also specify a location to save a timestamp
    All timers are saved automatically regardless if you specify a timestamp directory or not.
    Hover over the tray icon to reveal a pop-up summary window
